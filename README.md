# booktastic-server

Booktastic is a platform for distributed local libraries.  This is the PHP backend server; the frontend client
is [here](https://github.com/tasticbooktastic/booktastic-nuxt3) and the fast API server code is [here](https://github.com/tasticbooktastic/booktastic-server-go).

It was originally forked from [Iznik](https://github.com/freegle/iznik-server), which is the platform used
by [Freegle](https://www.ilovefreegle.org) for online gifting.
